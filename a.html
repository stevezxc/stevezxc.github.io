<p>Terrified, Elli and I tried all the bear defense actions we knew.</p>
<p>Seeing the approach of the polar bear, I froze with terror, too scared to move an inch.</p>
<p>My wife Elli grasped my clothes and trembled, swallowing hard.</p>
<p>A numbing chill  gripped me.</p>
<p>Thinking of the wolf’s bloody mouth, Mac was nearly dead with fright.</p>
<p>I was seized by a strong sense of horror, my palms sweating.</p>
<p>At the sight of it, Elli waved her hands wildly, screaming,“Help!”.</p>
<p>When we were safe on the helicopter up in the air, I was amazed to spot that the bear had finally torn down the fence and ran towards the food we left behind.</p>
<p>Having pulled the massive body out of the stump, Brian cleaned the wounds and then gave him careful treatment. Becky  knelt down and tended to the wolf together with Brian.</p>
<p>I went near the innocent one and held it in my hand and wiped the puppy till he had become dry.</p>
<p>Using a rock as the supporting point, I unlocked the chain and set the wolf free. </p>
<p>Elli and I learned our lesson: Be aware of a bear with a toothache.</p>
<p>Despite the chill autumn wind, their home was filled with the warmth of love and reunion.</p>
<p>The rain that came that day was a miracle, saving our farm, just like my boy saved a life.</p>
<p>Appearing to be feeling better, the wolf slowly raised his head and gave a gentle kiss to Becky’s hand as if to express thanks. What a warm scene!</p>
